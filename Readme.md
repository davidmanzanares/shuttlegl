# ShuttleGL

ShuttleGL is JS collection of tools to develop 3D graphics, including small WebGL abstractions.

ShuttleGL is **not** a WebGL framework nor a thick layer on top of WebGL.

ShuttleGL objective is to provide a collection of not-mutually coupled tools that implements functionality common in WebGL software, for example:
 - Shader compilation utils
 - Shader uniform bookkeeping utils
 - VAO construction
 - Camera view utils
 - Limited rendering of:
    - Points
    - Lines
    - Polygons

## Status

**DO NOT USE** yet, this project is being developed in an as-needed fashion as a dependency of another project.

Early stage, breaking API changes are expected. However, some of the small functionality that exists may already be useful.
